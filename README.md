# SpaCy-Language-Model-Comparison
The two Python programs contained within test out SpaCy's language models (small and medium).
In particular, they give examples of differing results between the two models when it comes to comparing semantic similarity.
The watch_next program can take a film's description and compare it to a list of other film descriptions.
It then recommends the most similar film for your viewing pleasure.
